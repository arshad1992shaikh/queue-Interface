Introduction
The Queue Interface Implementation project is a Java application that showcases the usage of the Queue interface and its implementations, such as LinkedList, PriorityQueue, and ArrayDeque. The program demonstrates various queue operations, complex queue manipulations, and performance analysis.
The program revolves around a Task class, which represents the tasks that are managed by the queues. The Task class has properties such as id, description, and priority, and it implements the Comparable<Task> interface to allow for natural ordering based on priority.
The main components of the program are:
QueueOperation: Provides methods to perform basic queue operations, such as enqueuing, dequeuing, peeking, and checking for task existence.
QueuePerformanceAnalysis: Measures the performance of enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations for different queue implementations.
ComplexQueueOperations: Provides methods to perform more advanced queue operations, such as sorting tasks in a LinkedList by priority, moving tasks from an ArrayDeque to a PriorityQueue based on a priority threshold, and merging two PriorityQueue instances.
TaskScheduler: Implements a real-world scenario where tasks are managed and scheduled based on their priority.
Main: The entry point of the program, which demonstrates the usage of all the other components.
